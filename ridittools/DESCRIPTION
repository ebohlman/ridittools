Description: Functions to compute ridit scores of vectors, compute mean ridits
  and their standard errors for vectors compared to a reference vector,
  as described in authors(1981, ISBN:0-471-06428-9) Fleiss, Joseph L., Statistical Methods for Rates and Proportions. New York: John Wiley & Sons.
  and compute means/SEs for multiple groups in matrices. Data can be either
  counts or proportions. Emphasis is on ridit analysis of ordered categorical data such as Likert items and
  pain-rating scales.
