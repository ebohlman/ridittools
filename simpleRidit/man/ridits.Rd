\title{
Compute mean ridits of multiple groups
%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
}
\description{
Computes mean ridits of multiple groups in a crosstab matrix. Groups can be either rows or columns,
with the other dimension representing the response categories.
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
}
\usage{
ridits(x, margin, ref = NULL)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
  matrix of cross-tabulated counts or proportions
%%     ~~Describe \code{x} here~~
}
  \item{margin}{
  1 for groups in rows, 2 for groups in columns
%%     ~~Describe \code{margin} here~~
}
  \item{ref}{
    if omitted, use totals across groups as reference group
  
  if vector of counts (or proportions), use as reference group
  
  otherwise, number (or name if it exists) of group to use as reference

%%     ~~Describe \code{ref} here~~
}
}
\details{
%%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~
}
\value{
vector of mean ridits
%%  ~Describe the value returned
%%  If it is a LIST, use

using group totals as reference will not give meaningful results if data are proportions
