\title{
Compute standard errors of mean ridits of multiple groups
%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
}
\description{
Takes the same data as \code{meanridits()}, bui returns standard errors rather than means.
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
}
\usage{
seridits(x, margin, ref = NULL)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
  same as for \code{meanridits()}, but must be counts rather than proportions
%%     ~~Describe \code{x} here~~
}
  \item{margin}{
  same as for \code{meanridits()}
%%     ~~Describe \code{margin} here~~
}
  \item{ref}{
  same as for \code{meanridits()}
%%     ~~Describe \code{ref} here~~
}
}
\details{
note that if the results include the reference group, its standard error will
not be meaningful; by definition its mean ridit will be exactly 0.5
%%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~
}
\value{
a vector of standard errors for each group's mean ridits
%%  ~Describe the value returned
%%  If it is a LIST, use
%%  \item{comp1 }{Description of 'comp1'}
%%  \item{comp2 }{Description of 'comp2'}
%% ...
